# Webapp configuration

This folder contains several configuration files for the WebApp:

- **GlobalConfiguration.json** defines constants specific to your application instance: you will need to change these
  values when creating a new staging or production version of your application
- **HelpMenuConfiguration.json** can be used to customize some menu entries in the webapp (e.g. links to documentation
  or support)
