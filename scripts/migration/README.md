# Azure Sample Webapp - Migration scripts

This folder contains **migration scripts** to help users migrate between major versions of the _Azure Sample Webapp_.
These scripts can not guarantee a full coverage of the manual operations required when switching to a new major version,
but they can automate some parts of the migration.

| :exclamation: Before running these scripts, please make sure you don't have uncommitted local changes in your webapp project. |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

This migration script requires **Node 16** or above to run. If you don't already have this version, you can install it
with:

```
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
```

# Supported versions

## Migrate from v2 to v3

`npx @cosmotech/migrate-azure-sample-webapp v3`

## Migrate from v4 to v5

`npx @cosmotech/migrate-azure-sample-webapp v5 [-s path/to/your/solution.yaml] [-w path/to/your/workspace.yaml]`

Optional parameters:

- `-s/--solution`: provide the path to an existing YAML solution description file to merge its content with your webapp
  configuration file src/config/ScenarioParameters.js and write the result in a new YAML file
- `-w/--workspace`: provide the path to an existing YAML workspace description file to merge its content with your
  webapp configuration file src/config/PowerBI.js and write the result in a new YAML file

# Dev notes

- `cd` to the folder containing the migration scripts (with files `migrate.js` and `package.json`) and run `npm link`
