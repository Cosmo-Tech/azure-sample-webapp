# Webapp - v3.0.0 migration guide

## Allow new redirection URL after login

The post-login redirection URL has been changed from `/scenario` to `/sign-in`. This URL has been modified to prevent a change of page during the interaction with the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) pop-up, that could cause the login to fail in some browsers.

You **must change the accepted redirect URLs** in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) of your _App Registration_, in the **_Authentication_** blade, and replace `/scenario` by `/sign-in` in the redirect URL of your web-app.

## Update configuration files

### Migration script

The structure of the front-end configuration files has changed in v3.0.0. To make the migration easier, a [migration script](https://github.com/Cosmo-Tech/azure-sample-webapp/tree/main/scripts/migration) has been created to automatically convert JS config files to the new format. You can run this script from the root folder of your webapp (still in v2.x) with:

```
# Install & use node 16 if necessary
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
# Call the migration script from your webapp root folder
npx @cosmotech/migrate-azure-sample-webapp v3
```

The script should create a folder **_src/config_v3_** with the expected files structure for v3.0.0 of the webapp. After merging (or rebasing on) the tag _v3.0.0-vanilla_, you will be able to replace the content of the folder _src/config_ by the files generated in _src/config_v3_.

### Detailed changes in the configuration folder

In case the migration does not work for your solution, or if you are just curious, this section provides a list of modifications to apply in your configuration folder to migrate from v2.x to v3.0.0.

#### Optional files

- **_Profiles.js_** (this file has been added in v2.2): if you don’t already have this file in your configuration folder, you can use [this empty template from the 3.0.0-vanilla tag](https://github.com/Cosmo-Tech/azure-sample-webapp/blob/v3.0.0-vanilla/src/config/Profiles.js)
- **_InstanceVisualization.js_** (this file has been added in v2.8): if you don’t already have this file in your configuration folder, you can use [this empty template from the 3.0.0-vanilla tag](https://github.com/Cosmo-Tech/azure-sample-webapp/blob/v3.0.0-vanilla/src/config/InstanceVisualization.js)

#### Renamed files

- **_Dashboards.js_** has been renamed to **_PowerBI.js_**; this file now also defines & exports these constants:
  - `POWER_BI_WORKSPACE_ID` (previously in _AppInstance.js_)
  - `USE_POWER_BI_WITH_USER_CREDENTIALS` (previously in _AppConfiguration.js_)
  - `SCENARIO_VIEW_IFRAME_DISPLAY_RATIO` (previously in _AppConfiguration.js_)
  - `DASHBOARDS_VIEW_IFRAME_DISPLAY_RATIO` (previously in _AppConfiguration.js_)
- **_AppInstance.js_** has been renamed to **_GlobalConfiguration.js_**; this file now only contains the 6 parameters below (other parameters have been moved to new files):
  - `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
  - `APP_REGISTRATION_CLIENT_ID`
  - `COSMOTECH_API_SCOPE`
  - `DEFAULT_BASE_PATH`
  - `ORGANIZATION_ID`
  - `WORKSPACE_ID`

#### New files

- **_ApplicationInsights.js_** defines & exports the constants `ENABLE_APPLICATION_INSIGHTS` (previously in _AppConfiguration.js_) and `APPLICATION_INSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY` (previously in _AppInstance.js_)
- **_HelpMenuConfiguration.js_** defines & exports the following constants (previously in _AppConfiguration.js_):
  - `SUPPORT_URL`
  - `COSMOTECH_URL`
  - `DOCUMENTATION_URL`
  - `APP_VERSION`
- **_Languages.js_** defines & exports the constants `LANGUAGES` and `FALLBACK_LANGUAGE` (previously in _AppConfiguration.js_)

#### Modified files

- ScenarioParameters.js now also defines & exports these constants (previously in _AppConfiguration.js_):
  - `ADD_SCENARIO_NAME_PARAMETER`
  - `ADD_SCENARIO_ID_PARAMETER`
  - `ADD_SCENARIO_LAST_RUN_ID_PARAMETER`
  - `ADD_SCENARIO_PARENT_ID_PARAMETER`
  - `ADD_SCENARIO_PARENT_LAST_RUN_ID_PARAMETER`
  - `ADD_SCENARIO_MASTER_ID_PARAMETER`
  - `ADD_SCENARIO_MASTER_LAST_RUN_ID_PARAMETER`
  - `ADD_SCENARIO_RUN_TEMPLATE_NAME_PARAMETER`

#### Other changes

The following parameters are highly technical and have been moved outside of the front-end configuration folder:

- `SESSION_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT`
- `SCENARIO_STATUS_POLLING_DELAY`
- `SCENARIO_RUN_LOG_TYPE`
- `POWER_BI_INFO_POLLING_DELAY`

## Transform your factories into React components

All generic factories that create tabs and inputs in Scenario Parameters have been transformed into React functional components and moved to the [src/components/ScenarioParameters](https://github.com/Cosmo-Tech/azure-sample-webapp/tree/main/src/components/ScenarioParameters/components) folder. Even if the factory mechanism is still supported in this version, it is considered deprecated and will be definitively removed in a future major version of the web app so we recommend to refactor all your custom factories into React functional components. It consists mainly in transforming the arguments of the create function in component's props:

```
// GenericTextInput replaces BasicTextInputFactory in v3:

import React from 'react';
import { BasicTextInput } from '@cosmotech/ui';
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next'; // using component's syntax lets you import the translation function directly in the input component
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; // React PropTypes lets you check the type of passing values

export const GenericTextInput = ({ parameterData, parametersState, setParametersState, context }) => {
const { t } = useTranslation();

  // ...

  return (
    <BasicTextInput
     //...
    />
  );
};
GenericTextInput.propTypes = {
  parameterData: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
  parametersState: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
  setParametersState: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  context: PropTypes.object.isRequired,
};
```

Note that unlike factories React components give access to the Redux store so, for example, there is no need to pass datasets as argument to your function since you can access it directly from component using `useSelector()` hook, like in GenericTable component:

```
// GenericTable component replaces TableFactory
// ...
const datasets = useSelector((state) => state.dataset?.list?.data);
// ...
```

Finally, `editMode` boolean is put in the `context` prop that can also serve as wrapper for every additional information, like `isDarkTheme` in the GenericTable component:

```
//...
return (
  <Table
    ...
    agTheme={context.isDarkTheme ? gridDark.agTheme : gridLight.agTheme}
    ...
  />
);
```

You can find more information about creating your custom components in the [web app documentation](https://github.com/Cosmo-Tech/azure-sample-webapp/blob/main/doc/scenarioParametersCustomization.md).

## New theme structure

In order to respect [Material UI’s theme structure](https://mui.com/material-ui/customization/default-theme/), the following changes have been made:

- theme is dynamic and has to be imported from Redux from now on; a button in the app bar allows to switch between dark and light theme;
- only _palette.js_, _grid.js_ and _pictures.js_ remain in dark and light theme directories:
  - _palette.js_ overrides Material UI classic variables, and defines custom ones
    - `primary`, `secondary`, `warning`, `success`, `info` and `error` are overridden in `palette.js` only when needed;
    - `main`, `dark`, `light` and/or `contrastText` properties of the above categories are specified only when needed;
    - custom variables define the Sign In with Microsoft button, as well as colors for the Sign In page, and the app bar fixed colors; integrators can define their own ones, but I strongly recommend to only specify `main`, `dark`, `light`, and/or `contrastText` properties;
  - _grid.js_ contains the specification for tables style in Scenario Parameters;
  - _pictures.js_ contains two versions of Cosmo's logo (one with black text, one with white text) as well as light or dark background images used on the Sign In page;
- _typography.js_ has been removed, Material UI default file is enough for now; NB: this doesn’t mean integrators cannot override typographies if they need to: the webapp simply doesn’t need it right now;
- _override_ directory’s files have been removed, for Material UI is already powerful enough in most cases; NB: same goes for this directory: integrators can still override components if they so desire;

## Migration to react-router v6

This section concerns projects that have developed custom views or routes only; if your web app uses build-in views, the following breaking changes shouldn’t impact it.

Web app v3.0.0 uses new version of [React Router](https://reactrouterdotcom.fly.dev/docs/en/v6) (v6) which implies some breaking changes:

- the router doesn’t support custom routes anymore; `<PrivateRoute>` and `<PublicRoute>` components were deleted from _@cosmotech/ui_ package so all custom routes in your web app must be replaced by regular `<Route>` (main routes have already been replaced in v3).
- `useHistory()` hook must be replaced with `useNavigate()` hook or `<Navigate />` component
- if you use custom views, the corresponding component must be called differently in the _AppLayout.js_ file:

```
const TABS = [
  {
    key: view key,
    label: view label,
    to: view path,
    // v2 :
    render: () => <View /> // eslint-disable-line
    // v3:
    render: <View /> // eslint-disable-line
  },
]
```

- `<Redirect>` and `<Switch>` components have been deprecated in the new version of React Router 6 and must be replaced by `<Routes>`. To avoid any confusion and stick to the React Router new syntax, the new `AppRoutes` component ([src/AppRoutes.js](https://github.com/Cosmo-Tech/azure-sample-webapp/blob/main/src/AppRoutes.js)) now replaces `Routes` component and regroups all application’s routes from `Routes` and `TabLayout` ([src/layouts/TabLayout/TabLayout.js](https://github.com/Cosmo-Tech/azure-sample-webapp/blob/main/src/layouts/TabLayout/TabLayout.js)). If you have customized routes in `TabLayout`, move all your modifications in `AppRoutes`:

```
const AppRoutes = (props) => {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route index element={...} replace />
      <Route path="/sign-in" element={...} />
      <Route path="/accessDenied" element={...} />
      <Route path="/" element={<TabLaout />}>
        {tabs.map((tab) => (
          <Route
            key={tab.key}
            path={tab.to}
            element={...}
          >
            {tab.to === '/scenario' && (
              <Route
                path="/scenario/:id"
                element={...}
              />
            )}
          </Route>
        ))}
      </Route>
    </Routes>
  );
};
```
